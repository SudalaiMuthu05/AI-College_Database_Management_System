## 🎓 CampusBuddy
### Connecting the Campus with Intelligent Database Conversations

CampusBuddy is a locally powered AI-driven SQL assistant that allows users to query a campus database using natural language. Instead of writing complex SQL queries, users can simply ask questions in plain English — and CampusBuddy intelligently converts them into optimized PostgreSQL queries and returns structured results.

## 🚀 Project Overview

CampusBuddy is designed as a research-inspired AI database agent that bridges natural language understanding and structured data retrieval.

## The system uses:
🧠 Local Large Language Model (Ollama + Mistral)
🐘 PostgreSQL database (200,000+ records)
⚙️ Flask backend
🎨 Modern animated UI
🔐 Secure SQL validation layer
